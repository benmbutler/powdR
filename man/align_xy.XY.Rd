\title{Align XRPD data in an XY object to a given standard}
\usage{
\method{align_xy}{XY}(x, std, xmin, xmax, xshift, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an \code{XY} object.}

\item{std}{a dataframe of the chosen standard that each
sample is aligned to (column 1 = 2theta, column 2 = counts)}

\item{xmin}{the minimum 2theta value used during alignment}

\item{xmax}{the maximum 2theta value used during alignment}

\item{xshift}{the maximum (positive and negative) 2theta shift
that is allowed during alignment}

\item{...}{other arguments}
}
\value{
an \code{XY} object.
}
\description{
\code{align_xy.XY} takes an XY object and aligns
it to a given standard. An optimisation routine is used
that computes a suitable linear shift.

\examples{
# Load soils xrd data
data(soils)

#Load minerals library
data(minerals)

#Create a standard quartz pattern to align to
